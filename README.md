# AboutMe
An interactive website I designed in 2013-2014 featuring some fast facts about me.

This website was created as the final project for Mark Connor's Basic Web Design Class.
To login to the site, use the username "guest1" and the password "passWord1".

NOTE: some of the CSS may no longer be working properly since this website was designed in 2013-2014.
